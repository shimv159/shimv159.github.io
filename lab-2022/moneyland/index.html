	 				After brainstorming about my internet history, I realized that much of my online existence relies on my ability to create—whether that means being an artist, designer, writer, or more. Ever since I was younger, the idea of capitalizing on my hobbies was encouraged by both my parents and the internet. However, as I grew older, I realized that there are many downsides to this seemingly perfect idea such as burnout, competition, and an overall lack of support. This then leads to exploitation of people in the creative industry, which is something that I'm deeply concerned about.
	 			</p>
	 			<p>
	 				Using the language of RPG Maker games I was fond of, I created a game mock-up with a "choose your own story format", where the player is presented with different options that nevertheless lead to the same desolate resolution. The game name and setting is Moneyland, a place advertised as "where dreams come true." The player is encouraged to pursue a creative career (artist or fashion designer) and the single objective is to pay their weekly rent in time. Over the course of a week, however, the player finds that their creativity does not translate into monetary value. Eventually, the player fails to pay rent in time—game over. The fictional world of Moneyland parallels that of the real, capitalistic world that constantly perpetuates the illusion of choice without acknowledging the privilege underlining the terms and conditions of success.

	  				As my project is particularly visual-heavy, I first created my art assets on Procreate and Photoshop. The art style I am utilizing is pixel art, which is a form of digital art drawn with the deliberate placements of pixels. I would start with an extremely small canvas (128 x 128 pixels), drew on it, then resampled it into a larger DPI. I would then take these rendered characters and place them into compositions and add texts. In this sense, my workflow resembles that of dioramas—placing characters and objects into settings to create a story. I would then export the slides into images and animate them on After Effects.

					The most gratifying part of this project was using the storytelling format of games I loved to tell a meaningful story about something close to my heart. The subject of capitalism squashing creativity is a frequent thought I have, and being able to visualize it feels cathartic. I have also been meaning to try pixel art, and while my first attempt here may not be the most successful, I genuinely put effort into executing it.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was particularly difficult to simplify my idea into something doable within two weeks. My original idea was more complicated; it had three routes with different interactions and characters. I soon realized that I wouldn't be able to execute that in time, and had to cut out a lot of my ideas. If I were to have more time, I would probably make the mock-up more complex and perhaps develop it into an actual game. But overall, I am satisfied with what I was able to come up with in this limited time.
