		<h1>Girl spaces: images of girlhood on the internet</h1>

			When Rookie, a now-defunct online magazine for teenage girls, launched in 2011, it created a safe space for young women and girls to express themselves through any medium they wanted and in a myriad of different ways. Thus images of girlhood ceased to be just a mystery for the male gaze/brain to solve or portray; they became eclectic, bountiful, contradictory even. Furthermore, since 2012 Instagram has played a vital role in the democratization of publishing one’s own art to a larger audience. It has combined the broad reach of an extremely popular social network with what were perceived as ‘niche’ interests – activities done privately (collage making, bullet journaling, diary keeping) or publicly (photography, poetry, music, art) by often self-taught or self-published teenage girls. Artists like Petra Collins and Ashley Armitage are entering mainstream popular culture and changing perspectives on what it means to be a girl, to feel like a girl or to look like a girl. They document girls’ bodies, bedrooms, emotions and material belongings, and offer to the consumer of their art these girl spaces for inspection, questioning and identification. Since the internet requires no (straight, white, cis, male) gatekeepers when it comes to creating an identity or curating art, girls’ voices are much easier to hear. This is why I chose to analyse a generation of artists who are gaining momentum because of the internet and subverting, as well as reimagining, the patterns and stereotypes created by centuries of men describing girls’ narratives as trivial, mundane and irrelevant.

			The internet is a tool girls can use to transform themselves from (passive?) observers to active participants/producers/influencers within girl culture and outside of it. While it should be kept in mind that not all girls have access to online spaces, the internet is by far the most efficient way for girls to connect with both other girls and broader audiences.

			Second, the internet remains a space where ‘ordinary people’ share their experiences and have a chance to become ‘extraordinary’ simply by virtue of having an ever-present audience. The internet does not reject ‘everydayness’, it feeds on it. It exists because of it. Much of girls’ existence is deemed too ordinary, trivial or banal to be represented as art and this perception automatically excludes girls from artistic production and consumption.

			Girl spaces are primarily perceived as deeply intimate, as girls themselves are primarily relegated to the sphere of the personal (McRobbie 2000, p. 73), but girls often seem unafraid to show them as such, whether they do it in the form of a blog post, or a mood board, or a simple Instagram snap:

				First her LiveJournal. Now her Tumblr. So many of these Tumblr spaces are gorgeously written. Many of these girls identify intensely as writers, as artists. These visual notebooks fetishize the handmade, the handwritten, the deeply-felt, posting images of their painfully scrawled notes or reposting others’ love letters or diary entries. (Zambreno 2012, p. 277)

			In her work on the suppression of women’s voices entitled Heroines, Zambreno approaches girls’ online spaces not just with great affection and deep understanding, but with due seriousness. Of all the ways in which girls express themselves online, writing adolescence is still probably the most overlooked art form. Diary keeping is a staple of ‘virtual bedroom culture’ (Reid-Welsh and Mitchell 2004, p. 174), yet it is considered to be even lower than other types of ‘girl art’ because ‘we live in a culture that punishes and tries to discipline the messy woman and her body and a literary culture that punishes and disciplines the overtly autobiographical (for being too feminine, too girly, too emotional)’ (Zambreno 2012, p. 252). Girls’ diaries are messy because girls are perceived as pure feeling. Funnily enough, there is not much talk about boys’ diaries – it is presumed that boys act on their feelings, while girls write about them. Men’s diaries, however, are regarded as precious insights into their thought processes, always technical, precise, clean: ‘Yet of course HE can write the autobiographical, but his work is read as aspiring to something greater. […] SHE is read as simply writing herself, her toxic, messy self’ (Zambreno 2012, p. 237). Zambreno focuses on novel writing where the autobiographical is purposefully interwoven with the fictional, but all of her arguments can be applied to any type of writing, any art form, in fact.

			As a blog writer herself, Zambreno postulates the first and most important reason why the internet, or some parts of it at least, is so essential to every aspiring artist or anyone who wants to express themselves: ‘these women form another invisible community for me – for we too feel invisible, but together we rally against our own erasure. My blog a way for me to negotiate and deal with this loneliness’ (Zambreno 2012, p. 180). Online spaces provide the tools necessary for girls to make themselves visible – to have some tangible proof they exist outside their bedrooms or, if we follow Reid-Welsh and Mitchell’s logic, to extend their bedrooms. So beyond fighting against erasure, other concepts emerge from Zambreno’s thoughts on online diary keeping and essay writing: girls are not simply extending their bedrooms, they are turning their bedrooms into communal spaces. <span class="highlight1"><a href="text4.html">What is intimate still needs to be shared.
