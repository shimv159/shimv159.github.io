		<h2>Olivia Rodrigo</h2>
		<p>
			I want it to be, like, messy
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm so insecure, I think
			That I'll die before I drink
			And I'm so caught up in the news
			Of who likes me and who hates you
			And I'm so tired that I might
			Quit my job, start a new life
			And they'd all be so disappointed
			'Cause who am I if not exploited?
			And I'm so sick of seventeen
			Where's my fucking teenage dream?
			<a href="page-10.html">If someone tells me one more time
			"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry</a>
			And I don't stick up for myself
			I'm anxious, and nothing can help
			And I wish I'd done this before
			And I wish people liked me more
		</p>
		<p>
			All I did was try my best
			This the kinda thanks I get?
			Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
			They say these are the golden years
			But I wish I could disappear
			Ego crush is so severe
			God, it's brutal out here
		</p>
		<p>
			(Yeah)
		</p>
		<p>
			I feel like no one wants me
			And I hate the way I'm perceived
			I only have two real friends
			And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
			'Cause I love people I don't like
			And I hate every song I write
			And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
			And I can't even parallel park
		</p>
		<p>
			All I did was try my best
			This the kinda thanks I get?
			Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
			They say these are the golden years
			But I wish I could disappear
			Ego crush is so severe
			God, it's brutal out here
		</p>
		<p>
			(Yeah)
			(Just havin' a really good time)
		</p>
		<p>
			Got a broken ego, broken heart
			(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)
			And God, I don't even know where to start
		</p>
