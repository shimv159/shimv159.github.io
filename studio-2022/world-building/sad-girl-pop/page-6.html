		<h2>FKA Twigs</h2>
		<p>
			A woman's work
			A woman's prerogative
			A woman's time to embrace
			She must put herself first
			A woman's touch, a sacred geometry
			I know where you start, where you end
			How to please, how to curse
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, I learnt you needed me
			Yes, I'm here to open you
			Yes, I know that your heart is blue
			(So cold)
		</p>
		<p>
			I fear before the fire
			True as Mary Magdalene
			Creature of desire
			Come just a little bit closer to me
			Step just a little bit closer to me
			I can lift you higher
			I do it like Mary Magdalene
			I want you to say it
			Come just a little bit closer 'til we collide
		</p>
		<p>
			A woman's hands
			So dark and provocative
			A nurturing breath that could stroke
			Your divine confidence
			<a href="page-7.html">A woman's war
			Unoccupied history</a>
			True nature won't search to destroy
			If it doesn't make sense
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, I learnt you needed me
			Yes, I'm here to open you
			Yes, I know that your heart is blue
			(So cold)
		</p>
		<p>
			I fear before the fire
			True as Mary Magdalene
			Creature of desire
			Come just a little bit closer to me
			Step just a little bit closer to me
			I can lift you higher
			I do it like Mary Magdalene
			I want you to say it
			Come just a little bit closer 'til we collide
		</p>
		<p>
			Ooh, you didn't hear me now
			Ooh, you didn't hear me when I told you
			Ooh, you didn't hear me now
		</p>
		<p>
			Mary Magdalene
			Creature of desire
			Come just a little bit, just a little bit
			Mary Magdalene
			Creature of desire
			Come just a little bit closer 'til we collide
		</p>
		<p>
			Ooh, you didn't hear me now
			Ooh, you didn't hear me when I told you
			Ooh, you didn't hear me now
