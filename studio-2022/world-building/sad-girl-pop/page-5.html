		<h1>mad woman</h1>
		<h2>Taylor Swift</h2>
		<p>
			What did you think I'd say to that?
			Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
			They strike to kill and you know I will
			You know I will
			What do you sing on your drive home?
			Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
			Does she smile?
			Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?
		</p>
		<p>
			Every time you call me crazy
			I get more crazy
			What about that?
			And when you say I seem angry
			I get more angry
		</p>
		<p>
			And there's nothin' like a mad woman
			What a shame she went mad
			No one likes a mad woman
			You made her like that
			And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
			And you find something to wrap your noose around
			And there's nothin' like a mad woman
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I breathe flames each time I talk
			My cannons all firin' at your yacht
			They say, "Move on", but you know, I won't
			And women like hunting witches, too
			Doing your dirtiest work for you
			It's obvious that wanting me dead
			Has really brought you two together
		</p>
		<p>
			Every time you call me crazy
			I get more crazy
			What about that?
			And when you say I seem angry
			I get more angry
		</p>
		<p>
			And there's nothin' like a mad woman
			What a shame she went mad
			No one likes a mad woman
			You made her like that
			And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
			And you find something to wrap your noose around
			And there's nothin' like a mad woman
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm takin' my time
			Takin' my time
			'Cause you took everything from me
			Watchin' you climb
			Watchin' you climb
			Over people like me
			The master of spin
			Has a couple side flings
			Good wives always know
			She should be mad
			Should be scathing like me
		</p>
