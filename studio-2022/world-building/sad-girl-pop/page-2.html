		<h1>Savior Complex</h1>
		<h2>Phoebe Bridgers</h2>
		<p>
			Emotional affair
			<br>
			Overly sincere
			<br>
			Smoking in the car
			<br>
			Windows up
			<br>
			Crocodile tears
			<br>
			Run the tap 'til it's clear
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Drift off on the floor
			<br>
			I drag you to the shore
			<br>
			Sweating through the heat
			<br>
			You're gonna drown in your sleep
			<br>
			For sure, wake up and start a big fire
			<br>
			In our one room apartment
			<br>
			But I'm too tired
			<br>
			To have a pissing contest
			<br>
			All the bad dreams that you hide
			<br>
			Show me yours, I'll show you mine
		</p>
		<p>
			Call me when you land
			<br>
			I'll drive around again
			<br>
			One hand on the wheel
			<br>
			One in your mouth
			<br>
			Turn me on and turn me down
		</p>
		<p>
			Baby, you're a vampire
			<br>
			You want blood and I promised
			<br>
			I'm a bad liar
			<br>
			With a savior complex
			<br>
			All the skeletons you hide
			<br>
			Show me yours, and I'll show you mine
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="page-3.html">All the bad dreams that you hide</a>
			<br>
			Show me yours
