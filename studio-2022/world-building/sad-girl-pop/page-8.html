		<h1>Two Slow Dancers</h1>
		<h2>Mitski</h2>
		<p>
			Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?
			It's funny how they're all the same
			It's funny how you always remember
			And we've both done it all a hundred times before
			It's funny how I still forgot
		</p>
		<p>
			It would be a hundred times easier
			If we were young again
			But as it is
			And it is
			We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
			We're two slow dancers, last ones out
		</p>
		<p>
			And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
			You see it on both our skin
			We get a few years and then it wants us back
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="page-9.html">It would be a hundred times easier
			If we were young again</a>
			But as it is
			And it is
			To think that we could stay the same
			To think that we could stay the same
			To think that we could stay the same
			But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
			We're two slow dancers, last ones out
			Two slow dancers, last ones out
