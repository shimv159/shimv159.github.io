		<h2>Japanese Breakfast</h2>

			Tell the men I'm coming, tell them count the days
			I can feel the night passing by like a mistake waiting for me
			Caught up in my feelings, overthink the truth
			Fantasize you've left me behind
			And I'm turned back running for you
		</p>
		<p>
			Make it up to me, you know it's better
			Make it up to me, you know it's better
		</p>
		<p>
			Be sweet to me, baby
			I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe (be sweet)
			Be sweet to me, baby
			I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in something
		</p>
		<p>
			So come and get your woman (come and get your woman)
			<a href="page-5.html">Pacify her rage (pacify her rage)</a>
			Take the time to undo your lies
			Make it up once more with feeling
			Recognize your mistakes and I'll let you back in
			Realize not too late, love you always
		</p>
		<p>
			Make it up to me, you know it's better
			Make it up to me, you know it's better
		</p>
		<p>
			Be sweet to me, baby
			I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe (be sweet)
			Be sweet to me, baby
			I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in something
			Be sweet to me, baby
			I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe (be sweet)
			Be sweet to me, baby
			I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in something
