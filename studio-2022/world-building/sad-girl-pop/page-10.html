		<h1>prom dress</h1>
		<h2>mxmtoon</h2>
		<p>
			I'm nearing the end
			Of my fourth year
			I feel like I've been lacking
			Crying too many tears
			Everyone seemed to say it was so great
			But did I miss out
			Was it a huge mistake?
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="page-1.html">I can't help the fact I like to be alone</a>
			It might sound kinda sad
			But that's just what I seem to know
			I tend to handle things
			Usually by myself
			And I can't ever seem to try and ask for help
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm sittin' here
			Crying in my prom dress
			I'd be the prom queen if crying was a contest
			Make-up is running down
			Feelings are all around
			How did I get here
			I need to know-oh-oh
		</p>
		<p>
			I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
			Thought I'd get to them
			But no I didn't
			I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
			But now I'm sittin' on the floor
			And all I wanna do is run
		</p>
		<p>
			I keep collections of masks upon my wall
			To try and stop myself from revealing it all
			Affecting others is the last thing I would do
			I keep to myself though I want to break through
			I hold so many small regrets
			And what ifs down inside my head
			Some confidence it couldn't hurt me
			My demeanor is often misread
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm sittin' here
			Crying in my prom dress
			I'd be the prom queen if crying was a contest
			Make-up is running down
			Feelings are all around
			How did I get here
			I need to know-oh-oh
		</p>

			I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
			Thought I'd get to them
			But no I didn't
			I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
			But now I'm sittin' on the floor
			And all I wanna do is run
			All I wanna do is run...
			All I wanna do is run
			All I wanna do is run
		</p>
