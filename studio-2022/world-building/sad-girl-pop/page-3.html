			The drink you spilt all over me
			"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
			My mom and dad let me stay home
			It drives you crazy getting old

			We can talk it so good
			We can make it so divine
			We can talk it good
			How you wish it would be all the time

			I want 'em back, I want 'em back
			The minds we had, the minds we had
			How all the thoughts, how all the thoughts
			Moved 'round our heads, moved 'round our heads
			I want 'em back, I want 'em back
			The minds we had, the minds we had
			It's not enough to feel the lack
			I want 'em back, I want 'em back, I want 'em

			You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
			Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
			And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
			But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)
