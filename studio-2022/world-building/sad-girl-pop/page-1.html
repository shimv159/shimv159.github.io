			My God, I'm so lonely
			<br>
			So I open the window
			<br>
			To hear sounds of people
			<br>
			To hear sounds of people
		</p>
		<p>
			Venus, planet of love
			<br>
			Was destroyed by global warming
			<br>
			Did its people want too much, too?
			<br>
			Did its people want too much?
		</p>
		<p>
			And I don't want your pity
			<br>
			I just want somebody near me
			<br>
			Guess I'm a coward
			<br>
			I just want to feel alright
		</p>
		<p>
			And I know no one will save me
			<br>
			I just need someone to kiss
			<br>
			Give me one good honest kiss
			<br>
			And I'll be alright
		</p>
		<p>
			Nobody, nobody, nobody
			<br>
			Nobody, nobody
			<br>
			Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody
		</p>
		<p>
			I've been big and small
			<br>
			And big and small
			<br>
			And big and small again
			<br>
			And still nobody wants me
			<br>
			Still nobody wants me
		</p>

			I'm just asking for a kiss
			<br>
			Give me one good movie kiss
			<br>
			And I'll be alright

		<p>
			Nobody, nobody, nobody
			<br>
			Nobody, nobody
			<br>
			Ooh, nobody, nobody
			<br>
			Nobody, nobody, nobody

			Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

			Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

			Nobody, nobody, nobody (nobody)
