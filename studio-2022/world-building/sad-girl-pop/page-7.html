		<h1>Get Free</h1>
		<h2>Lana Del Rey</h2>
		<p>
			Finally... I'm crossing the threshold
			From the ordinary world to the reveal of my heart
		</p>
		<p>
			Undoubtedly... That will for certain
			Take the dead out of the sea and the darkness from the arts
		</p>
		<p>
			This is my commitment, my modern manifesto
			I'm doing it for all of us who never got the chance
			For... and for... (shut up, shut up)
			And all my birds of paradise (shut up, shut up)
			Who never got to fly at night (shut up, shut up)
			<a href="page-8.html">'Cause they were caught up in the dance</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
			I want to get off, but I keep riding the ride
			I never really noticed that I had to decide
			To play someone's game, or live my own life
		</p>
		<p>
			And now I do, I wanna move
			Out of the black (out of the black)
			Into the blue (into the blue)
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally... Gone is the burden of the Crowley way of being
			That comes from energies combined
		</p>
		<p>
			Like my part was I, was not discerning
			And you, as we found out, were not in your right mind
		</p>
		<p>
			There's no more chasing rainbows and hoping for an end to them
			Their arches are illusions, solid at first glance
			But then you try to touch them (touch, touch)
			There's nothing to hold on to (hold, hold)
			The colors used to lure you in (shut up, shut up)
			And put you in a trance (ah, ah, ah, yeah)
		</p>
